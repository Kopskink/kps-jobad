## Description
KPS-JobAD is a simple yet effective script designed to allow in-game jobs to promote themselves for roleplay purposes through the in-game chat. This system enhances the immersive experience by enabling job roles to broadcast advertisements directly within the game environment.

## Customizability
KPS-JobAD offers a decent level of customizability, making it easy to change the script to your specific needs. Users can almost effortlessly configure various options through the `config.lua` file. The script's source code is also available, allowing for further modifications to suit any unique requirements.

## Configurability
Configurability options include:
+ Enabling or disabling the payment system for each individual ad, providing flexibility depending on the server's economy.
+ Setting specific monetary transactions either from a player's personal bank account or from the society's funds, depending on your roleplay server's economic structure.

## Compatibility
KPS-JobAD is designed with compatibility in mind, ensuring seamless integration with popular banking and chat systems used in roleplay servers. The script currently supports the 'Renewed-Banking' system for society funds management, and can be adapted to work with other systems with minimal code adjustments.

## Installation
1. Place the `kps-jobad` folder in your FiveM server's resources directory.
2. Add `ensure kps-jobad` to your `server.cfg` file.
3. Configure the `config.lua` file as needed.
4. Restart the server and enjoy.

## Usage
Once installed and configured, job roles can start using the `/jobad` command to broadcast their advertisements in the in-game chat. The command will automatically deduct the specified amount from the configured account (either society money or the player's personal account).
